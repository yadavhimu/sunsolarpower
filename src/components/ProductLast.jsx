         <p className='text-xl mt-10'>As it is an investment, it’s important to consider your out-of-pocket costs when planning for a home solar system. </p>
         <p className='text-xl mt-10'>With the right installation plan, it’s possible to reduce or even eliminate your electricity usage costs every month. We’ll help you see where the break-even point is (when the solar panels have been paid off) and you have free energy for many years down the road.</p>
         <p className='text-xl mt-10'>One way to leverage your budget is by taking advantage of federal tax incentive programs. For example, there are options to get a tax credit for up to 30% of your installation costs, including both materials and labor.</p>
         <p className='text-xl mt-10'>There is no need to delay installation if you don’t have cash to pay for these services out-of-pocket. Our team at Freedom Solar offers simple financing solutions with options for $0-down installation. We can also help you achieve an affordable monthly payment until the equipment is paid in full. You will enjoy the financial benefits for many years into the future.</p>
