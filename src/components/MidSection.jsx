        Why Should You Have Solar Panels Installed at Your Home?
        </p>
        <p className=' text-2xl mt-2 p-8'>
        Installing solar panels is an upfront cost, but a smart investment that saves homeowners thousands on household electricity costs while increasing your home price. Solar helps reduce your carbon footprint and improve local air quality. With our variety of financing options, putting residential solar panels on your home can be less than your electric bill, including options like our $0 down and low interest rates, with approved credit.
